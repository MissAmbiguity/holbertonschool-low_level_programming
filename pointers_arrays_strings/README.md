Arrays in C
This project explores the fundamental concepts of arrays in the C programming language. In C, an array is a collection of elements of the same type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Understanding arrays is crucial for efficient data manipulation and storage. Throughout this project, we delve into topics such as array declaration, indexing, and manipulation. Arrays play a pivotal role in organizing and accessing data, and mastering their usage is foundational for any C programmer. This project aims to enhance your proficiency in working with arrays, setting the stage for more advanced programming concepts.
