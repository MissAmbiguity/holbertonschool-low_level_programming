# C Programming Basics

Hey there, welcome to my C Programming Basics repository! This is where I'm documenting my journey as I delve into the world of C programming. As a student eager to explore new programming languages, I've started this collection of exercises to capture my learning process and experiences while tackling the fundamentals of C.

The C programming language has a rich history and a significant influence on modern computing. Initially crafted by Dennis Ritchie back in the early 1970s at Bell Labs, it has since become a cornerstone in system software, embedded systems, and application development. Through this repository, I aim to understand the language's origins, the people behind it like Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan, and its essential role in shaping the technology landscape.

Throughout this project, I'll be diving into various key concepts of C programming, starting from the ground up. From comprehending the 'main' function to learning how to compile code using 'gcc' on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, I'll explore standard libraries, best coding practices using the Betty style, and other fundamental programming principles. Join me on this learning adventure as I develop a solid foundation in C programming.
